          <h3>A realistic alternative to Kerosene lamps.</h3>

            <p>There are currently over 1.5 billion people in the World who have no reliable access to mains electricity. These people rely, instead, on <em>biomass</em> fuels (mostly kerosene) for lighting once the sun goes down. We propose a sustainable lighting solution powered by gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>GravityLight</strong>, an off-line project which is now at a working prototype stage.</p>

            <h3>Share the cause</h3>

            <p>Thanks to help of our supporters we have now successfully secured funding for the trial phase of the GravityLight Mk1.</p>
            <p>We will gift them to villagers in both Africa and India to use regularly. The follow-up research will tell us how well the lights met their needs, and enable us to refine the design for a more efficient MK2 version. Once we have proved the design, we will be looking to link with NGOs and partners to distribute it as widely as possible. When mass produced the target cost for this light is less than $5.</p>

            
                    <h3>What will the funds be used for?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Deciwatt</strong> is our initiative to try to make this happen through our existing network of clients, and connections to groups who share our hopes for <strong>GravityLight</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The funds we are currently seeking to raise will cover a trial of Gravity Light with target users. The aim of this trial is to give us insights into:</p>

                    <ul>
			            <li><strong>Environmental factors</strong> (such as particle ingress, humidity variation etc).</li>
			            <li><strong>Installation</strong> (how easy or difficult the unit is for users to set up and understand).</li>
			            <li><strong>Semantics</strong> (how the product is perceived / understood).</li>
			            <li><strong>Power Range</strong> (if the range of adjustment and the power levels available are suitable for user's needs).</li>
                        <li><strong>Linking</strong> (if linking multiple GL's together will offer benefits that are desirable to users).</li>
                        <li><strong>Appropriate peripherals</strong> (task light, string of lights, radio, battery charger etc).</li>
                        <li><strong>Life tests</strong> (how the system performs over an extended period).</li>
                        <li><strong>Transit tests</strong> (how well the product stands up to the rigours of transportation).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If additional funds are raised, over and above the Gravity Light trial requirements, there are other short-term and longer-term objectives we will seek to address:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        In the short term
                        <li><strong>Final Drive</strong> (refinement and improvement to the final stage of the drive train to further increase efficiency and reduce production costs)</li>
                        <li><strong>Generator</strong> (performance, efficiency and lifespan of AC generator vs. DC generator)</li>
                        <li><strong>PWM</strong> (cost / benefit of pulsed light output vs. mechanical drive-train adjustment)</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost optimisation</strong> (identification and implementation of further production cost reductions)</li>
                        <li><strong>LED optimisation</strong> (identification of LED components to improve performance within cost targets)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The approach we have taken in developing and evaluating GravityLight has been a 'good enough' benchmark method against the types of kerosene lamp it is intended to replace. We are utilising low power to deliver a viable alternative to kerosene light, and we are delivering several times the light of a kerosene lamp for task lighting a workspace, at minimum.</p> 
                    <p>A good example of the thinking behind this approach - with some very useful information, numbers and discussion - can be found in Evan Mills paper:<br />
                    <a href="http://evanmills.lbl.gov/pubs/pdf/offgrid-lighting.pdf">Technical and Economic Performance Analysis of Kerosene Lamps and Alternative Approaches to Illumination in Developing Countries</a> (Mills, 2003)</p>
                    <ul>
                        In the longer term
                        <li><strong>Can GL act as a 'battery'</strong> (adapting GL and target electronic devices so GL can act as a replacement for their on-board batteries)</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalability</strong> (investigating the scalability of the principle for other applications)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The ultimate goal for our longer term research is to establish if/how small amounts of constant power can be utilised to provide access to the internet, from very remote locations, at incredibly low cost.</p>
