                        <p><strong>deciwatt.org</strong> is a research initiative focussed on low power devices.<br /><a href="#gravitylight"><strong>GravityLight</strong></a> is a product of this initiative.</p>
		                <p>We envisage other projects which bring together <span class="underline"><strong>low-power</strong> electronics with <strong>off-grid</strong> energy generation</span> to connect the unconnected. Access to the world's knowledge via the internet, peer to peer communication and education are possible for these people using today's electronics, if built from the ground up.</p>
                        <p><strong>deciwatt.org</strong> is our initiative to try to make this happen through our existing network of clients, and connections to groups who share our hopes for GravityLight.</p>
                        <p><a href="http://therefore.com"><em><strong>therefore</strong></em></a> has over 20 years of experience in designing and developing handheld computing and communication products for a host of pioneers including Psion, Toshiba, NEC, TomTom, Inmarsat, ICO, Sepura, Racal Acoustics, Voller energy etc. We work at the heart of an industry which is driven by Moore's law. However there is another less known parallel trend, called Koomey's law.</p>
                        <blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koomey%27s_law">Koomey's law</a> describes a long-term trend in the history of computing hardware. The number of computations per joule of energy dissipated has been doubling approximately every 1.57 years. This trend has been remarkably stable since the 1950s (R2 of over 98%) and has actually been somewhat faster than Moore’s law. Jonathan Koomey articulated the trend as follows: “at a fixed computing load, the amount of battery you need will fall by a factor of two every year and a half.”<sup>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koomey%27s_law">1</a>]</sup></blockquote>
                        <p>Many would say that this trend just keeps pace with the increasing sophistication of computing. However it also has a flip side. It means that relatively simple devices progressively need less energy to run. Similar efficiencies have been seen in radio communication too, opening up the possibility of low cost, off-grid computing and communication equipment. </p>
                        <p>Our vision has evolved from two self-funded projects exploring low power opportunities and solutions for the developing world. The first was the <strong>Talking Stick</strong> project, presented to Cambridge Wireless as a concept to bring communication to the unconnected. The second is <a href="#gravitylight"><strong>GravityLight</strong></a>, an off-line project which is now at a working prototype stage, seeking funding via Indiegogo.</p>

          <h3>A realistic alternative to Kerosene lamps.</h3>

            <p>There are currently over 1.5 billion people in the World who have no reliable access to mains electricity. These people rely, instead, on <em>biomass</em> fuels (mostly kerosene) for lighting once the sun goes down. We propose a sustainable lighting solution powered by gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>GravityLight</strong>, an off-line project which is now at a working prototype stage.</p>

            <h3>Share the cause</h3>

            <p>Thanks to help of our supporters we have now successfully secured funding for the trial phase of the GravityLight Mk1.</p>
            <p>We will gift them to villagers in both Africa and India to use regularly. The follow-up research will tell us how well the lights met their needs, and enable us to refine the design for a more efficient MK2 version. Once we have proved the design, we will be looking to link with NGOs and partners to distribute it as widely as possible. When mass produced the target cost for this light is less than $5.</p>

            
                    <h3>What will the funds be used for?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Deciwatt</strong> is our initiative to try to make this happen through our existing network of clients, and connections to groups who share our hopes for <strong>GravityLight</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The funds we are currently seeking to raise will cover a trial of Gravity Light with target users. The aim of this trial is to give us insights into:</p>

                    <ul>
			            <li><strong>Environmental factors</strong> (such as particle ingress, humidity variation etc).</li>
			            <li><strong>Installation</strong> (how easy or difficult the unit is for users to set up and understand).</li>
			            <li><strong>Semantics</strong> (how the product is perceived / understood).</li>
			            <li><strong>Power Range</strong> (if the range of adjustment and the power levels available are suitable for user's needs).</li>
                        <li><strong>Linking</strong> (if linking multiple GL's together will offer benefits that are desirable to users).</li>
                        <li><strong>Appropriate peripherals</strong> (task light, string of lights, radio, battery charger etc).</li>
                        <li><strong>Life tests</strong> (how the system performs over an extended period).</li>
                        <li><strong>Transit tests</strong> (how well the product stands up to the rigours of transportation).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If additional funds are raised, over and above the Gravity Light trial requirements, there are other short-term and longer-term objectives we will seek to address:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        In the short term
                        <li><strong>Final Drive</strong> (refinement and improvement to the final stage of the drive train to further increase efficiency and reduce production costs)</li>
                        <li><strong>Generator</strong> (performance, efficiency and lifespan of AC generator vs. DC generator)</li>
                        <li><strong>PWM</strong> (cost / benefit of pulsed light output vs. mechanical drive-train adjustment)</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost optimisation</strong> (identification and implementation of further production cost reductions)</li>
                        <li><strong>LED optimisation</strong> (identification of LED components to improve performance within cost targets)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The approach we have taken in developing and evaluating GravityLight has been a 'good enough' benchmark method against the types of kerosene lamp it is intended to replace. We are utilising low power to deliver a viable alternative to kerosene light, and we are delivering several times the light of a kerosene lamp for task lighting a workspace, at minimum.</p> 
                    <p>A good example of the thinking behind this approach - with some very useful information, numbers and discussion - can be found in Evan Mills paper:<br />
                    <a href="http://evanmills.lbl.gov/pubs/pdf/offgrid-lighting.pdf">Technical and Economic Performance Analysis of Kerosene Lamps and Alternative Approaches to Illumination in Developing Countries</a> (Mills, 2003)</p>
                    <ul>
                        In the longer term
                        <li><strong>Can GL act as a 'battery'</strong> (adapting GL and target electronic devices so GL can act as a replacement for their on-board batteries)</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalability</strong> (investigating the scalability of the principle for other applications)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The ultimate goal for our longer term research is to establish if/how small amounts of constant power can be utilised to provide access to the internet, from very remote locations, at incredibly low cost.</p>
