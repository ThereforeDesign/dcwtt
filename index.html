          <h3>A realistic alternative to Kerosene lamps.</h3>

            <p>There are currently over 1.5 billion people in the World who have no reliable access to mains electricity. These people rely, instead, on <em>biomass</em> fuels (mostly kerosene) for lighting once the sun goes down. We propose a sustainable lighting solution powered by gravity.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Our vision evolved from two self-funded projects exploring low power opportunities and solutions for the developing world. The first was the <strong>Talking Stick</strong> project, presented to Cambridge Wireless as a concept to bring communication to the unconnected.</p>

            <p>The second is <strong>GravityLight</strong>, an off-line project which is now at a working prototype stage, seeking funding via <strong style="color: #1A1A1A;">Kick</strong><strong style="color: #87C442;">starter</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Share the cause</h3>

            <p><u>We need your help</u> to fund the tooling, manufacture and distribution of at least 1000 gravity powered lights. </p>
            <p>We will gift them to villagers in both Africa and India to use regularly. The follow-up research will tell us how well the lights met their needs, and enable us to refine the design for a more efficient MK2 version. Once we have proved the design, we will be looking to link with NGOs and partners to distribute it as widely as possible. When mass produced the target cost for this light is less than $5.</p>

            <h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>

            <p>We work at the heart of an industry which is driven by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's law</a>. However there is another less known parallel trend, called <strong>Koomey's law</strong>.</p>

            <blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koomey%27s_law">Koomey's law</a> describes a long-term trend in the history of computing hardware. The number of computations per joule of energy dissipated has been doubling approximately every 1.57 years. This trend has been remarkably stable since the 1950s (R2 of over 98%) and has actually been somewhat faster than Moore’s law. Jonathan Koomey articulated the trend as follows: “at a fixed computing load, the amount of battery you need will fall by a factor of two every year and a half.”<sup>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koomey%27s_law">1</a>]</sup></blockquote>

            <p>Many would say that this trend just keeps pace with the increasing sophistication of computing. However it also has a flip side. It means that relatively simple devices progressively need less energy to run. Similar efficiencies have been seen in radio communication too, opening up the possibility of low cost, off-grid computing and communication equipment.</p>

            <p>We envisage other projects which bring together low power electronics with off-grid energy generation to connect the unconnected. Access to the worlds knowledge via the internet, peer to peer communication and education are possible for these people using todays electronics, if built from the ground up.</p>

            <h3>Who are we?</h3>

            <p>We are <a href="http://therefore.co.uk">Therefore</a> and we have over 20 years of experience in designing and developing hand held computing and communication products for a host of pioneers including Psion, Toshiba, NEC, TomTom, Inmarsat, ICO, Sepura, Racal Acoustics, Voller energy etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Deciwatt</strong> is our initiative to try to make this happen through our existing network of clients, and connections to groups who share our hopes for <strong>GravityLight</strong>.</p>
