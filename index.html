                        <p><strong>deciwatt.org</strong> is a research initiative focussed on low power devices.<br /><a href="/#gravitylight"><strong>GravityLight</strong></a> is a product of this initiative.</p>
		                <p>We envisage other projects which bring together <span class="underline"><strong>low-power</strong> electronics with <strong>off-grid</strong> energy generation</span> to connect the unconnected. Access to the world's knowledge via the internet, peer to peer communication and education are possible for these people using today's electronics, if built from the ground up.</p>
                        <p><strong>deciwatt.org</strong> is our initiative to try to make this happen through our existing network of clients, and connections to groups who share our hopes for GravityLight.</p>
                        <p><a href="http://therefore.com"><em><strong>therefore</strong></em></a> has over 20 years of experience in designing and developing handheld computing and communication products for a host of pioneers including Psion, Toshiba, NEC, TomTom, Inmarsat, ICO, Sepura, Racal Acoustics, Voller energy etc. We work at the heart of an industry which is driven by Moore's law. However there is another less known parallel trend, called Koomey's law.</p>
                        <blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koomey%27s_law">Koomey's law</a> describes a long-term trend in the history of computing hardware. The number of computations per joule of energy dissipated has been doubling approximately every 1.57 years. This trend has been remarkably stable since the 1950s (R2 of over 98%) and has actually been somewhat faster than Moore’s law. Jonathan Koomey articulated the trend as follows: “at a fixed computing load, the amount of battery you need will fall by a factor of two every year and a half.”<sup>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koomey%27s_law">1</a>]</sup></blockquote>
                        <p>Many would say that this trend just keeps pace with the increasing sophistication of computing. However it also has a flip side. It means that relatively simple devices progressively need less energy to run. Similar efficiencies have been seen in radio communication too, opening up the possibility of low cost, off-grid computing and communication equipment. </p>
                        <p>Our vision has evolved from two self-funded projects exploring low power opportunities and solutions for the developing world. The first was the <strong>Talking Stick</strong> project, presented to Cambridge Wireless as a concept to bring communication to the unconnected. The second is <a href="/#gravitylight"><strong>GravityLight</strong></a>, an off-line project which is now at a working prototype stage, seeking funding via Indiegogo.</p>

            <h3>[Update 24 May]</h3>

<p>Dear Supporters,</p>
<p>We’ve had a great response from those of you offering to help with the GravityLight trial. Thank you!</p>
<p>There are respondents who have offered their support in getting feedback on GravityLight from over 27 different countries – not to mention the feedback we hope to get from pledgees who requested a light.</p>
<p>The map below shows the range of locations that people have offered to help us trial GravityLight in communities with minimal access to electricity and using kerosene lamps for light.</p>
<img src="images/trialquestionaires.jpg" width="" />
<p>On the production side, we are continuing to commission injection molding tools for production.</p>
<p>Below are photos of the tool for the sprocket, which the strap runs around [right] and the multi-action injection molding tool for tool for the one-way ratchet, which enables the strap to rewind when lifting up the ballast bag [left].</p>
            <img src="images/sprocket.jpg" width="" />

<p>Bought-in components are now en route to the factory and our final wave of tooling will be started over the next few weeks. About this time we also aim to share what Jim and Rob have been working intensely on: now that the production engineering detail is complete, they will be able to show us what GravityLight will look like in this first production run!</p>
            <p>You can find all previous update at <a href="/updates/">www.deciwatt.org/updates</a>.</p>
            <p>Many Thanks,<br />

          <h3>A realistic alternative to Kerosene lamps.</h3>

            <p>There are currently over 1.5 billion people in the World who have no reliable access to mains electricity. These people rely, instead, on <em>biomass</em> fuels (mostly kerosene) for lighting once the sun goes down. We propose a sustainable lighting solution powered by gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>GravityLight</strong>, an off-line project which is now at a working prototype stage.</p>

            <h3>Share the cause</h3>

            <p>Thanks to help of our supporters we have now successfully secured funding for the trial phase of the GravityLight Mk1.</p>
            <p>We will gift them to villagers in both Africa and India to use regularly. The follow-up research will tell us how well the lights met their needs, and enable us to refine the design for a more efficient MK2 version. Once we have proved the design, we will be looking to link with NGOs and partners to distribute it as widely as possible. When mass produced the target cost for this light is less than $5.</p>
