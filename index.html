                        <p><strong>deciwatt.org</strong> is a research initiative focussed on low power devices.<br /><a href="#gravitylight"><strong>GravityLight</strong></a> is a product of this initiative.</p>
		                <p>We envisage other projects which bring together <span class="underline"><strong>low-power</strong> electronics with <strong>off-grid</strong> energy generation</span> to connect the unconnected. Access to the world's knowledge via the internet, peer to peer communication and education are possible for these people using today's electronics, if built from the ground up.</p>
                        <p><strong>deciwatt.org</strong> is our initiative to try to make this happen through our existing network of clients, and connections to groups who share our hopes for GravityLight.</p>
                        <p><a href="http://therefore.com"><em><strong>therefore</strong></em></a> has over 20 years of experience in designing and developing handheld computing and communication products for a host of pioneers including Psion, Toshiba, NEC, TomTom, Inmarsat, ICO, Sepura, Racal Acoustics, Voller energy etc. We work at the heart of an industry which is driven by Moore's law. However there is another less known parallel trend, called Koomey's law.</p>
                        <blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koomey%27s_law">Koomey's law</a> describes a long-term trend in the history of computing hardware. The number of computations per joule of energy dissipated has been doubling approximately every 1.57 years. This trend has been remarkably stable since the 1950s (R2 of over 98%) and has actually been somewhat faster than Moore’s law. Jonathan Koomey articulated the trend as follows: “at a fixed computing load, the amount of battery you need will fall by a factor of two every year and a half.”<sup>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koomey%27s_law">1</a>]</sup></blockquote>
                        <p>Many would say that this trend just keeps pace with the increasing sophistication of computing. However it also has a flip side. It means that relatively simple devices progressively need less energy to run. Similar efficiencies have been seen in radio communication too, opening up the possibility of low cost, off-grid computing and communication equipment. </p>
                        <p>Our vision has evolved from two self-funded projects exploring low power opportunities and solutions for the developing world. The first was the <strong>Talking Stick</strong> project, presented to Cambridge Wireless as a concept to bring communication to the unconnected. The second is <a href="#gravitylight"><strong>GravityLight</strong></a>, an off-line project which is now at a working prototype stage, seeking funding via Indiegogo.</p>

            <h3>[Update 12 Feb]</h3>
            <p>We've taken the opportunity to draw breath as our current manufacturing partner has taken leave for <strong>Chinese New Year</strong>.</p>

            <p>As the campaign was running so successfully we accelerated our programme and worked hard over the Christmas and new year period to issue revised data for a new iteration of development plastic parts.</p>

            <p>We now have these parts and are currently <strong>testing under extreme loads</strong> to help understand points of failure in the mechanism. We have included some pictures below to illustrate this process. To help keep the manufacturing cost as low as possible we are using plastic rather than metal gears so it's vital that we rigorously test this aspect.</p>
            
            <img src="images/update-testE.jpg" />

            <p>The additional funds raised through your fantastic support for the campaign has allowed us to further refine and test functionality ahead of trial. This means we are ironing out some of the issues we had thought we would have to address during the trial programme. So the good news is the trial units can be more representative of the product that we aim to finally bring to market.</p>

            <p><strong>It does mean that we are having to revise our schedule</strong> and it looks like we will slip the original expectation possibly by a couple of months. We want the lights to be as good as possible for this trial, and the additional R&D progress we are making will benefit the <strong>much larger production build we are now undertaking</strong>. We felt that all who await their own GravityLight would understand this and, hopefully agree.</p>

            <p>We will post a more accurate schedule soon and of course will continue to provide updates on our general progress. <strong>One key aspect of which is identifying the candidates</strong> who will support the trial programme by distributing, controlling and feeding back the research on users' experiences.</p>

            <p>More detailed updates will be posted regularly at <a href="updates.html">www.deciwatt.org/updates</a>.</p>

          <h3>A realistic alternative to Kerosene lamps.</h3>

            <p>There are currently over 1.5 billion people in the World who have no reliable access to mains electricity. These people rely, instead, on <em>biomass</em> fuels (mostly kerosene) for lighting once the sun goes down. We propose a sustainable lighting solution powered by gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>GravityLight</strong>, an off-line project which is now at a working prototype stage.</p>

            <h3>Share the cause</h3>

            <p>Thanks to help of our supporters we have now successfully secured funding for the trial phase of the GravityLight Mk1.</p>
            <p>We will gift them to villagers in both Africa and India to use regularly. The follow-up research will tell us how well the lights met their needs, and enable us to refine the design for a more efficient MK2 version. Once we have proved the design, we will be looking to link with NGOs and partners to distribute it as widely as possible. When mass produced the target cost for this light is less than $5.</p>
