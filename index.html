          <h3>A realistic alternative to Kerosene lamps.</h3>

            <p>There are currently over 1.5 billion people in the World who have no reliable access to mains electricity. These people rely, instead, on <em>biomass</em> fuels (mostly kerosene) for lighting once the sun goes down. We propose a sustainable lighting solution powered by gravity.</p>

                <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/53588182" class="shadow" width="400" height="230" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>Our vision evolved from two self-funded projects exploring low power opportunities and solutions for the developing world. The first was the Talking Stick project, presented to Cambridge Wireless as a concept to bring communication to the unconnected.</p>
                <p>The second is <em>GravityLight</em>, an off-line project which is now at a working prototype stage, seeking funding via KickStarter.</p>

            <h3>Share the cause</h3>

            <p><u>We need your help</u> to fund the tooling, manufacture and distribution of at least 1000 gravity powered lights. We will gift them to villagers in both Africa and India to use regularly. The follow-up research will tell us how well the lights met their needs, and enable us to refine the design for a more efficient MK2 version. Once we have proved the design, we will be looking to link with NGOs and partners to distribute it as widely as possible. When mass produced the target cost for this light is less than $5.</p>

            <h3>Who are we?</h3>

            <p>We are <a href="http://therefore.co.uk">Therefore</a> and we have over 20 years of experience in designing and developing hand held computing and communication products for a host of pioneers including Psion, Toshiba, NEC, TomTom, Inmarsat, ICO, Sepura, Racal Acoustics, Voller energy etc. We work at the heart of an industry which is driven by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's law</a>. However there is another less known parallel trend, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koomey%27s_law">Koomey's law</a>.</p>

            <h3>What is Deciwatt?</h3>

            <p>Deciwatt is our initiative to try to make this happen through our existing network of clients, and connections to groups who share our hopes for GravityLight. We envisage other projects which bring together low power electronics with off-grid energy generation to connect the unconnected. Access to the worlds knowledge via the internet, peer to peer communication and education are possible for these people using todays electronics, if built from the ground up.</p>
