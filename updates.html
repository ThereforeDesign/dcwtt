            <h3>[Update 12 Feb]</h3>
            <p>We've taken the opportunity to draw breath as our current manufacturing partner has taken leave for <strong>Chinese New Year</strong>.</p>

            <p>As the campaign was running so successfully we accelerated our programme and worked hard over the Christmas and new year period to issue revised data for a new iteration of development plastic parts.</p>

            <p>We now have these parts and are currently <strong>testing under extreme loads</strong> to help understand points of failure in the mechanism. We have included some pictures below to illustrate this process. To help keep the manufacturing cost as low as possible we are using plastic rather than metal gears so it's vital that we rigorously test this aspect.</p>
            
            <img src="images/update-testE.jpg" />

            <p>The additional funds raised through your fantastic support for the campaign has allowed us to further refine and test functionality ahead of trial. This means we are ironing out some of the issues we had thought we would have to address during the trial programme. So the good news is the trial units can be more representative of the product that we aim to finally bring to market.</p>

            <p><strong>It does mean that we are having to revise our schedule</strong> and it looks like we will slip the original expectation possibly by a couple of months. We want the lights to be as good as possible for this trial, and the additional R&D progress we are making will benefit the <strong>much larger production build we are now undertaking</strong>. We felt that all who await their own GravityLight would understand this and, hopefully agree.</p>

            <p>We will post a more accurate schedule soon and of course will continue to provide updates on our general progress. <strong>One key aspect of which is identifying the candidates</strong> who will support the trial programme by distributing, controlling and feeding back the research on users' experiences.</p>

            <p>More detailed updates will be posted regularly at <a href="updates.html">www.deciwatt.org/updates</a>.</p>

            <p>All the best,<br />

            <h3>Dear contributors,</h3>
            <p>Wow. After 40 amazing days the campaign has now closed, raising almost US$ 400,000. We want to extend our <a href="/#thanks">heartfelt thanks</a> to all of you who have helped us. Rather than using our time to individually respond to all your inspiring comments, weâ€™ve been getting on with the main job in hand. No offence.</p>

            <p>We are working flat out to complete the production specification and already have the second tranche of tooling underway with our supplier in China. We hope to minimise any delay caused by the imminent Chinese New Year holiday and will be sending separate updates on progress in a few weeks.</p>
            
            <p>The interest in this campaign has been and continues to be overwhelming, with lot's of people interested in pledging beyond the end of the campaign.
